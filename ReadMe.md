<!-- Instalation -->
## Installation Dependencies
 - Start terminal and type below command in terminal to point to the project folder:

 ```
 ~$ E:\
 ~$ cd Lenovo\Updated
 ```

 - Now we need to download all the dependencies required to run the script. For this we will type below command in terminal:

 ```
 ~$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```

<br />

<!-- Understanding File -->
## Understanding Project File

#### requirement.txt üö´
This file contains all the dependencies that we need to install on our system. You can delete this file but its Ok to keep it there and forget that it exists. **Please never touch this file**.

#### script.py üö´
This file is the main script that we need to run to get the desired output. **Please never touch this file**.

#### config.json ‚úçÔ∏è
This file needs to be edited everytime you run the script and so it needs some explation...

 - **features** => Link to the product's features webpage.

 - **specifications** => Link to the product's specifications webpage.
 - **cover_background_color** =>  Color of the background. Should be in hexcode like #000080.
 - **cover_text_color** =>  Color of text on the webpage. Should be in hexcode like #FFFFFF.
 - **features_images_width** =>  Width of the images in the features section.

<br />

<!-- Running the script -->
## Running The Script
 So before running the script please make sure of two things:

 - You have edited the config file properly.
 - The pointer in terminal is pointing to the project forlder. If not then use below code:

 ```
 ~$ E:\
 ~$ cd Lenovo\Updated
 ```

Now we need to enter below code to execute the script.

```
~$ python3 script.py
```

Now just grab yourself a pint of üç∫ and let the script do its task.
